# HARP Flutter Application

## Goal

 The goal of this project is to create Heart Attack Risk Predictor[HARP], a mobile application that is designed to use On-Device Machine Learning through  
inference of TFLite model file invoked by TensorFlow Interpreter. Doing so, the application works even without internet and fetches the output from the model that is integrated/embedded on the application itself, there by reducing the latency, Increased reliability, security and Privacy of user data.
